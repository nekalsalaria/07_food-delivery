## 🌟 Project Overview
This is a modern, responsive food delivery web application that allows users to browse, search, and filter food items, as well as add them to a shopping cart. The UI is built using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, with global state handled by **Redux** and **Context API** for specific components.

The goal of this project was to create a smooth and intuitive experience for users looking to order food online, with real-time interactions and responsive layouts. This was a personal project developed entirely by me to demonstrate frontend and state management skills.
